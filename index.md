_Popper_ is a tool for conducting scientific explorations and writing 
academic articles following a 
[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) approach. Popper allows 
researchers to automate the execution and validation of computational and 
data-intensive experimentation workflows. To learn more about Popper you can:

  * Read [our blog][blog].
  * Download [our publications][pubs].
  * [Email us](mailto:ivo@cs.ucsc.edu), 
    [chat](https://gitter.im/systemslab/popper) or [open an 
    issue](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/issues/new).
  * Read the [official documentation][docs].
  * Install the [command line tool][cli] and go over the [quickstart 
    guide][quickstart].

We are currently working with researchers in many domains to create 
reusable Popper [tasks and workflows](https://github.com/popperized). 
If you are interested in contributing but are not certain on how to 
start, please feel free to contact us.
